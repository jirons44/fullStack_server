# fullStack_server
     
## Tech
- express
- Mongoose
- passport
- passport-google-oauth20
- cookie-session
### Oranization
- config
- routes
- services 
- index.js
###### authentication
- Request comes in
- Cookie-Session Extracts cookie data
- Passport pulls user id out of cookie data
- deserialize User a func to turn user id from cookie into a user from mongoDb
- User model instance added to req object as 'req.user'
- request sent to route handler ( now has user )

###### deployed on Heroku:  
> must have:
 -dynamic PORT binding, 
 -specify NODE environment, 
 -start script
 -.gitignore for node_modules
 
>downloaded heroku cli using brew install heroku/brew/heroku
 -heroku CLI commands
 -heroku -version
 -heroku login
 -heroku create  : 
     returns nam of app and git deployment target repository, e.g.
     
     *** use target repo ....add a remote repository to our current repository and name it 
     git remote add heroku somename.git
     
     
     git push heroku master : tell git to push our repository, can be used everytime to refresh ur code
     
     heroku open  : will open the web browser using heroku URL or just use URL
     
     heroku logs  : show logs

###### Sign-up with google oauth

 - http://console.developers.google.com/
 - create new project.  i called it *fullstack-server-dev*
- search for google+ api and enable it
- click on credentials...
- pick oauth clientid
- click on configure consent screen 
- fill in product name *fullstack-server-dev*
- pick web application

- authorized java script origins : http://localhost:5000

- authorized redirect url : ** http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback

- pop-up with creds...
  client id:  a public token..okay to share. 
    
  client secret:  this needs to be secured 

# client react app 
## run create-react-app client

### script result 
- Success! Created client at /Users/jiron/workspace/playground/grider/fullstack/fullStack_server/client
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

 - yarn start
    Starts the development server.

 - yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

 - yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

 - yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

- We suggest that you begin by typing:

   cd client
  yarn start

### notes

- this install also creates a built in 'server'. u can run 'npm start' while in the client directory.  This will 
launch the browswer localhost:3000 and display a react boilerplate web app.
launch the browswer localhost:3000 and display a react boilerplate web app.

- so we have two servers....reason why you want to have a 2nd sever for development.
- Our express fullstack_server is only responsible for pulling out of mongo and returning JSON.
- React side of our app, react server created by 'create-react-app'...will take component files bundle.js 
using webpack and babel

But Why?  we can put together...let express server up bundle.js.  yes we can.
